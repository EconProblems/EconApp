            Supply is a fundamental concept in economics that refers to the quantity of goods and services producers are willing to offer for sale in the market. Imagine a farmer who grows apples or a company that manufactures smartphones â€“ the amount of apples or smartphones they are willing to sell at different prices is their supply. <br /><br />

            Several factors influence supply, and these are known as determinants of supply. The main determinants are:<br /><br />

            <strong>Land:</strong> This includes all natural resources used in production, such as fertile soil, minerals, and water. For example, a farmer with more fertile land can produce a larger supply of crops.<br /><br />

            <strong>Labor:</strong> The human effort and skills put into producing goods and services. If a business has a well-trained and motivated workforce, they can increase their supply.<br /><br />

            <strong>Entrepreneurship:</strong> This involves the creativity and risk-taking abilities of individuals who start and manage businesses. Entrepreneurs can impact supply through their innovative ideas and business decisions.<br /><br />

            <strong>Capital:</strong> Refers to the tools, machinery, and equipment used in the production process. When a company has advanced technology and modern equipment, they can produce more efficiently, leading to a higher supply.<br /><br />

            Now, let's talk about the supply curve. The supply curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity producers are willing to supply. When the price of a good or service increases, the quantity supplied also tends to rise, resulting in an upward-sloping supply curve.<br /><br />

            <strong>When the supply curve shifts to the right:</strong> <br />This happens when there is an increase in supply at every price level. For instance, if there is a bumper harvest of apples, the supply of apples will increase, and the supply curve will shift to the right.<br /><br />

            <br /><br />
            <strong>When the supply curve shifts to the left:</strong> <br />On the other hand, this occurs when there is a decrease in supply at every price level. For example, if a natural disaster damages smartphone factories, the supply of smartphones will decrease, causing the supply curve to shift to the left.<br /><br />
